# Testr
A comprehensive technical screening and evaluation app. Testr is designed to be able to accommodate registration of candidates who can then apply for a cohort of The Bulb Africa Fellowship anytime applications are open. Applicants can then take the required entry exam and be graded as part of the application requirements right in the same app. Candidates can also view their application status that can be changed by admins(staff of The Bulb Africa) at the backend. Upon a change in the application status of an applicant, an email notification is sent to applicants.
